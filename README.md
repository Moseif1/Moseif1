I help businesses save time by automating repetitive work using Python, Google Apps Script, Google Workspace, and SQL.

If you’re spending hours on manual reporting, data cleanup, approvals, or emails — I can automate it.  

- What I can help with: 
- Google Sheets automation (reports, dashboards, formulas) 
- Google Forms → Sheets → Email workflows 
- Google Workspace automation (Drive, Gmail, Calendar) 
- Python automation & API integrations 
- SQL queries & data extraction  

I focus on simple, reliable automations that are easy to maintain.  

I’m happy to: 
- Review your process 
- Suggest improvements 
- Deliver a quick demo before finalizing  

Let’s automate the boring stuff so you can focus on what matters.
